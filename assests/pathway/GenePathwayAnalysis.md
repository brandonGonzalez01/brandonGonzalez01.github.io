Gene Pathway Analysis
================

Data Source Info
----------------

The expression data comes from GEO entry GSE37704, which is associated with the following publication:

Trapnell C, Hendrickson DG, Sauvageau M, Goff L et al. Differential analysis of gene regulation at transcript resolution with RNA-seq. Nat Biotechnol 2013 Jan;31(1):46-53. PMID: 23222703

They reported knockdown of HOX1a changes many thousands of transcript's expression levels.

Overview
--------

We are going to use DESeq2 for our analysis, this requires countData and metaData. CountData is raw unnormalized count data of mRNA. metaData is a table that tells us which samples were treated and which weren't. We will find which genes change in a statisically meaningful way and with these genes correlate them to pathways that are being affected.

first lets set the filenames and open

``` r
metafilename <- "data/GSE37704_metadata.csv"
datafilename <- "data/GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"
#take a peak, meta data maps the condition and the gene ID
colData <- read.csv(file=metafilename, row.names = 1)
head(colData)
```

    ##               condition
    ## SRR493366 control_sirna
    ## SRR493367 control_sirna
    ## SRR493368 control_sirna
    ## SRR493369      hoxa1_kd
    ## SRR493370      hoxa1_kd
    ## SRR493371      hoxa1_kd

Let us read in count data

``` r
countData <- read.csv(file=datafilename, row.names = 1)
head(countData)
```

We see there is a length column in *countData*, that is not needed so we can go ahead and remove it. Lets also make sure that the column names line up with the rows of the metadata

``` r
countData <- as.matrix(countData[ ,-1])
head(countData)
```

### Volcano Plot

``` r
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj))
```

![](GenePathwayAnalysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

lets color this plot

``` r
#repeat gray color for all samples which is equal to nrows of the result
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res))
#color the genes where fold change is greater than 2
mycols[abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2] <- "red"

#color the genes where the pvalue is less than 0.01 AND l2fc is greater than 2
mycols[abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 & (res$padj < 0.01)] <- "Blue"
```

``` r
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col = mycols)
```

![](GenePathwayAnalysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

Blue genes are of interest for pathway analysis. lets select those for pathway analysis. But first we should annotate them.

Annotating genes
----------------

``` r
biocLite("AnnotationDbi")
```

``` r
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

    ## 

``` r
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

    ##  [1] "ACCNUM"       "ALIAS"        "ENSEMBL"      "ENSEMBLPROT" 
    ##  [5] "ENSEMBLTRANS" "ENTREZID"     "ENZYME"       "EVIDENCE"    
    ##  [9] "EVIDENCEALL"  "GENENAME"     "GO"           "GOALL"       
    ## [13] "IPI"          "MAP"          "OMIM"         "ONTOLOGY"    
    ## [17] "ONTOLOGYALL"  "PATH"         "PFAM"         "PMID"        
    ## [21] "PROSITE"      "REFSEQ"       "SYMBOL"       "UCSCKG"      
    ## [25] "UNIGENE"      "UNIPROT"

We are going to use mapIds() from annotationDbi

``` r
res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = rownames(res), 
                    keytype = "ENSEMBL", column = "SYMBOL", 
                    multiVals = "first")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:many mapping between keys and columns

``` r
head(res$symbol)
```

    ## ENSG00000279457 ENSG00000187634 ENSG00000188976 ENSG00000187961 
    ##              NA        "SAMD11"         "NOC2L"        "KLHL17" 
    ## ENSG00000187583 ENSG00000187642 
    ##       "PLEKHN1"         "PERM1"

Lets do this with entrez and the gene name

``` r
res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = rownames(res), 
                    keytype = "ENSEMBL", column = "ENTREZID", 
                    multiVals = "first")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:many mapping between keys and columns

``` r
res$name = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = rownames(res), 
                    keytype = "ENSEMBL", column = "GENENAME", 
                    multiVals = "first")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:many mapping between keys and columns

``` r
head(res)
```

#### Finally, lets write the results based on the Pvalue

``` r
res = res[order(res$pvalue), ]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

Pathway Analysis
----------------

We will be using gage package for pathway analysis

``` r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

``` r
library(pathview)
```

Pathway is the first column in the matrix of the less or more attributes of the kegg object (the left most column above)

Lets do the first five pathways, automate this process

``` r
#focus on 5 upregulated pathways
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggRes$greater)[1:5]

#lets get the first 8 characters as that is the pathwayID
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
